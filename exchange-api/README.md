# Node
 Node is main executable
 Node needs exchange API key and secret in format: "key:secret" for initilaize client,
 client is interface that handles major methods of each exchange  

 -srv flag define rpc addres for bind  
 -db flag define redis address  

 Client functionality: 
  - Place buy and sell orders
  - Getting order information and status
  - Getting all completed and executed orders, that was created using this client 
  - Getting orderbook for given market
  - Cancel orders by orderid and market or cancel all orders
  - Getting balance

 Node using jsonrpc 2.0 protocol for rpc calls:
 ## RPC methods:
  - `buy`
  - `sell`
  - `order_info`
  - `order_status`
  - `cancel_all`
  - `cancel_market`
  - `cancel_trade`
  - `completed`
  - `executed`
  - `orderbook`

  and you can add specific handlers for each exchange
  api/rpc package contains more documentation - methods, params structures for each call, return values and description for each method
  rpc endpoints for each exchange are different -  
  http://rpcaddr:rpcport/c2cx and http://rpcaddr:rpcport/cryptopia, respectively
